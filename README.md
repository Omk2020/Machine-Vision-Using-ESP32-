	Voice Control Pick and Place Robot Integrated with Machine Vision
      Description:
•	 A voice-controlled pick-and-place robot integrated with machine vision uses OpenCV for image processing
•	 YOLO for object detection,  
•	ArUco codes for precise marker recognition, enabling the robot to accurately identify, grasp, and position objects based on voice commands. 
•	This system combines speech recognition with advanced visual processing for enhanced automation and user interaction camera
•	Uses Library like:
•	cvlib: A high-level library built on top of OpenCV, used here for object detection.
•	NumPy: A library for numerical operations, though not directly used in this code, it is often used for handling image arrays.
